# Java-Code-Challenge

# Instructions
- After running the program the user will be received with a simple command line menu.
- 3 Options will be given:
   1. To simulate the first game (when the player gets at least one 6 with 4 attempts wins)
   2. To simulate the second game (when the player gets a double 6 once with 24 attempts)
   3. To exit the program

To choose the option you want, just enter the number associated to it.

Classes that one should find in this project are the super class (Game), the subclasses (OneDieGame and TwoDiceGame), the runner and GameTests which is a simple test suite that makes sure the functionality works (Attempted to achieve 100% coverage, also note that I used JUnit).

Also included javadocs in all classes with information of what every section of the code does.
